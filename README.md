# My 3-Week JavaScript Confidence Sprint

## Week 1: Logic & Promises

* [ ] **Project 1: Simple Quiz App**
    * **Concept Focus:** Logic building, DOM manipulation, handling user events.
    * **Description:** A 3-5 question quiz. The user selects an answer, and the app instantly tells them if it's right or wrong and keeps score.
* [ ] **Project 2: Basic Weather App**
    * **Concept Focus:** `fetch`, `async`/`await`, handling JSON data, basic promises.
    * **Description:** An input box for a city name. On submit, it fetches the current temperature from a free weather API and displays it.

## Week 2: Advanced Async & OOP

* [ ] **Project 3: Recipe Finder**
    * **Concept Focus:** `Promise.all` (or multiple `await`s), complex API data.
    * **Description:** A search bar for an ingredient (e.g., "chicken"). Fetches from a recipe API and displays a list of matching recipes. *Bonus: Call two different APIs at once.*
* [ ] **Project 4: Class-Based To-Do List**
    * **Concept Focus:** OOP (`class`), `constructor`, methods, managing `this`.
    * **Description:** A simple to-do list where each task is an *instance* of a `Todo` class. You can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

## Week 3: Integration & Refinement

* [ ] **Project 5: Movie Search App**
    * **Concept Focus:** Integrating multiple concepts. Using `class` for both an `APIClient` and a `Movie` object.
    * **Description:** A search bar that hits a movie database API (like TMDB). Results are displayed as a grid. Each movie's data is stored in a `Movie` object.
* [ ] **Project 6: Refactor Project 1 (Quiz App)**
    * **Concept Focus:** Refactoring, applying new knowledge.
    * **Description:** Take your first quiz app and rebuild it using a `Quiz` or `Question` class. Clean up your `async` code or add a new feature using your knowledge from the last two weeks.
